# TODO

Probably mostly programming-related things will go here, with higher-level thinking in [the Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Svh1CvN9Rou0bSOJYFeF1c9osqcPWAqX).

## Hand Logic

- Define more complex motions: pick the desired hand positions for each extreme of each joystick axis, then define the paths that hands should take as the axes are moved to those extremes.
- Write function that interprets from hand (or joystick) position to ability meaning. Might just be axis >= 0.9.

## VFX

- Come up with basic structure for developing spell effects. Likely some combination of:
  - Pre-existing assets
  - 3D models
  - Shaders
